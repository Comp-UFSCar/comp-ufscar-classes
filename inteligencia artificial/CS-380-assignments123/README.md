##Introduction##
This is the coding part of the first three assignments of the course CS 380: Artificial Intelligence.

##Notes##

 * All the test-cases were considered and inserted in the Maps directory. However, they were renamed to fit in a loading pattern.
 * Hashtables were used to store the expanded nodes. The methods equals(Object _game) and hashCode() were implemented
to allow the correct comparison between elements in these sets.
 * The heuristic implement did not show a better pattern than the previous heuristic.
